        "11-13" : "Corrosion Prevention: protection can be achieved through passivation techniques and molybdate based inhibitors, even in the presence of high pH levels that are favorable to copper stability.",
        ">13" : "The anodizing enhances natural protective coating of copper. Coatings: Hot acid, if possible, should be further protected with epoxy or coatings resistant to alkalis. Inhibitors: The rate of corrosion is lowered using inhibitors based on borate or sodium molybdate.",
