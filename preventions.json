        "0-2": "Organic and phosphate corrosion inhibitors are used in highly acid environments. Organic molecules in solution block active sites on the metal surface and form an impermeable barrier from deposited phosphate coatings. In cases involving sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, polymer coatings or linings such as epoxy can be highly effective.",
        "2-4" : "In combination with corrosion inhibitors like zinc phosphate or chromates, corrosion is mitigated with galvanizing, or coating with zinc. Cathodic protection is commonly used to protect against oxidation.",
        "4-6" : "Organic coatings, in combination with chemicals, such as phosphating or protective films, on bitumen-based coatings have proven effective for surface passivation. Low-carbon steels can also be used in such applications since they are less susceptible to acid corrosion.",
        "7" : "Carbon steel corrodes slowly in neutral conditions. It is normally protected by barrier coatings, anodic protection techniques, or protective paints. Furthermore, surface texturing can improve corrosion resistance as it also decreases the area exposed to corrosive substances.",
        "7-9" : "applying protective coatings like epoxy or polymeric coatings is essential, especially in harsh environments. In alkaline conditions, corrosion tends to slow down naturally. However, in certain marine environments, it is important to note that some corrosion inhibitors can weaken the effectiveness of sacrificial anodes made of materials like magnesium or zinc, which are commonly used to reduce corrosion.",
        "9-11" : "Alkaline-resistant coatings, combined with inhibitors like silicates or polyphosphates are effective for corrosion prevention. These inhibitors form stable surface complexes that act as a protective barrier, stopping corrosion before it starts. By applying these coatings and inhibitors, you can ensure long-lasting protection, even in environments where steel is exposed to alkaline conditions.",
        "11-13" : "An effective method for preventing corrosion is to use organic inhibitors like alkanolamines, which create a protective coating on the steel surface. These inhibitors work by blocking active sites on the metal, reducing the rate of corrosion by limiting the surface's exposure to the environment.",
        ">13" : "There are several effective strategies to prevent carbon steel from corroding in high pH environments. One approach is the use of inhibitors like molybdate and phosphates, which form protective coatings in strongly alkaline solutions, slowing down the corrosion process. Surface treatments, such as applying a zinc-rich primer or epoxy/polyurethane coatings, create a physical barrier that shields the steel. Additionally, cathodic protection, an electrochemical technique, is commonly used in highly alkaline conditions to further prevent corrosion.",
